# Easy stock ticker

Based on a [pr](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/pull/7828)

# Search bar doesn't automatically select
Felt like there wasn't much of a reason for this since no keyboard input is required elsewhere, the creative menu is the same way too so its nothing new for compat

# Right-click and left-click on the requested stack had the same effect
Right click now removes half the stack, very useful to quickly narrow down like 8 of an item
Similar effect to shift scroll but since the player isn't really told the exact controls, its better to give options to explore, and more mechanically precise

# Scroll is very useful, but requires lots of movement and isn't very precise
Shift + scroll now snaps the item to the nearest 1/4 stack, so its much quicker to scale
